# About

Stuck with boring lectures? Drowning in a sea of PDFs? Grinding through tedious homework every night? For many students, staying motivated is harder than ever.

Here we introduce **G2L AI**, a Gemini-AI powered platform built for Rice students that transforms ANY FILE into a fun and visualized learning game. We use TypeScript, CSS, HTML with Google API to develop this tool, and build a community within it, so that you can then share your games with the Rice community, where students can rate and the best ones will be recommended to you. 

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set Google API Key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
